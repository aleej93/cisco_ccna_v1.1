# üìò Study Material: 1.1a Routers

**Exam Objective:** _Domain 1.1 ‚Äî Explain the role and function of network components: Routers_

---

## üîπ Quick Summary

A **router** is a networking device that connects different networks together and forwards data between them. Think of it as a "traffic director" for the Internet ‚Äî it decides the best path for data to travel from one network to another.

---

## üîπ What is a Router?

A router is a **Layer 3 (Network Layer) device** that operates using IP addresses to make forwarding decisions.

**Simple explanation:**

- Routers connect **separate networks** (like your home network to the Internet, or your company's New York office to its Tokyo office)
- They read the **destination IP address** on data packets and determine where to send them next
- Unlike switches (which connect devices within the same network), routers connect **different networks**

**Key Point:** Routers enable communication **between LANs** and over the **Internet**.

---

## üîπ Primary Functions of a Router

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Path Selection (Routing)

- Routers maintain a **routing table** that contains information about networks and how to reach them
- They use this table to determine the **best path** for data to reach its destination
- This process is called **routing**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Packet Forwarding

- Once the best path is determined, the router **forwards the packet** out the appropriate interface toward the destination
- This is called **forwarding**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting Different Networks

- Routers connect **multiple networks** (LANs to WANs, branch offices to headquarters, home networks to ISPs)
- Each router interface typically belongs to a **different network**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Logical Addressing (IP Addressing)

- Routers operate at **Layer 3** and use **IP addresses** to route traffic
- They can route both **IPv4** and **IPv6** traffic

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Network Segmentation

- Routers separate **broadcast domains** ‚Äî broadcasts from one network don't cross into another
- This improves network performance and security

---

## üîπ How Routers Make Forwarding Decisions

> **Note:** This ties directly into **Exam Objective 3.2** (Determine how a router makes a forwarding decision by default), which we'll cover in more depth later. For now, here's the foundation:

When a router receives a packet, it follows this process:

1. **Reads the destination IP address** in the packet header
2. **Looks up the destination** in its routing table
3. **Selects the best match** using:
   - **Longest prefix match** (most specific route wins)
   - **Administrative Distance** (if multiple routing sources exist)
   - **Metric** (if multiple routes from the same source exist)
4. **Forwards the packet** out the appropriate interface

**Example:**

```
Router receives packet destined for 192.168.10.5

Routing Table:
- 192.168.10.0/24 ‚Üí Interface G0/0
- 0.0.0.0/0 (default route) ‚Üí Interface G0/1

Decision: Forward via G0/0 (longest prefix match)
```

## üîπ Router vs. Switch vs. Layer 3 Switch

| Feature               | **Router**                        | **Switch**                      | **Layer 3 Switch**           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **OSI Layer**         | Layer 3 (Network)                 | Layer 2 (Data Link)             | Layer 2 & 3                  |
| **Uses**              | IP addresses                      | MAC addresses                   | Both MAC & IP addresses      |
| **Purpose**           | Connect different networks        | Connect devices in same network | Combines switching + routing |
| **Port Count**        | Fewer (2-10+)                     | Many (24-48+)                   | Many (24-48+)                |
| **Broadcast Domains** | Separates them                    | Single broadcast domain         | Can separate them            |
| **Speed**             | Slightly slower (more processing) | Very fast                       | Very fast                    |

**Key Difference:**

- **Switches** connect devices **within** the same LAN (like PCs, printers, servers in one office)
- **Routers** connect **different LANs** together (like connecting your office network to the Internet or another office)
- **Layer 3 switches** can do both, but are typically used for routing **within** a large campus network

## üîπ Common Cisco Router Models (For CCNA Context)

| Model        | Use Case                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **ISR 900**  | Small branch offices                |
| **ISR 1000** | Small to medium businesses          |
| **ISR 4000** | Medium to large enterprises         |
| **ASR 1000** | Service provider edge, data centers |

**Note:** For CCNA labs and simulations, you'll often work with **ISR routers** in Packet Tracer or GNS3.

## üîπ Router Interfaces

Routers have **fewer interfaces** than switches because they connect networks, not individual devices.

**Common Interface Types:**

| Interface Type                               | Description                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Ethernet (GigabitEthernet, FastEthernet)** | Connect to LAN switches or other routers        |
| **Serial**                                   | Legacy WAN connections (less common now)        |
| **Fiber (SFP/SFP+)**                         | High-speed connections, long distances          |
| **Console**                                  | Management access via cable (for configuration) |
| **Auxiliary**                                | Remote management via modem (rarely used today) |

**Example Interface Naming:**

- `GigabitEthernet0/0` or `G0/0`
- `GigabitEthernet0/1` or `G0/1`

## üîπ Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Your company has two offices ‚Äî one in New York and one in Tokyo.

- **New York Office:**
  - LAN: `192.168.1.0/24`
  - Router: `R1`
  - Connected to ISP via interface `G0/1`
- **Tokyo Office:**
  - LAN: `192.168.2.0/24`
  - Router: `R2`
  - Connected to ISP via interface `G0/1`

**What happens when a PC in New York (192.168.1.10) wants to access a server in Tokyo (192.168.2.50)?**

1. PC sends packet to its **default gateway** (R1)
2. R1 looks up `192.168.2.50` in its routing table
3. R1 forwards packet to the **ISP** (via the Internet)
4. Packet travels through multiple routers across the Internet
5. Packet reaches R2 in Tokyo
6. R2 forwards packet to server at `192.168.2.50`

**Without routers, the two offices couldn't communicate!**

## üîπ Key Differences: Routing vs. Switching

| Aspect                | **Routing (Routers)**   | **Switching (Switches)**  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Connects**          | Different networks      | Devices in same network   |
| **Operates at**       | Layer 3 (Network Layer) | Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) |
| **Uses**              | IP addresses            | MAC addresses             |
| **Forwards based on** | Routing table           | MAC address table         |
| **Breaks up**         | Broadcast domains       | Collision domains         |

---

## üîπ Additional Context: Default Gateway

**What is a default gateway?**

- The **IP address of the router** that devices use to reach other networks
- Every device on a network needs a default gateway configured to access the Internet or other networks

**Example:**

- PC IP: `192.168.1.100`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
- Default Gateway: `192.168.1.1` ‚Üê This is the router's IP address

When the PC wants to reach `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS), it sends the packet to `192.168.1.1` (the router), and the router forwards it toward the Internet.

---

## üîπ Routing Protocols (Brief Introduction)

Routers can learn routes in three ways:

1. **Directly Connected Networks**
   - Networks directly attached to the router's interfaces
   - Automatically added to the routing table

2. **Static Routes**
   - Manually configured by a network administrator
   - Example: "To reach 10.0.0.0/8, send packets to 192.168.1.254"

3. **Dynamic Routing Protocols**
   - Routers automatically share routing information with each other
   - Examples: **OSPF, EIGRP, BGP**
   - _We'll cover these in Domain 3.0 (IP Connectivity)_
