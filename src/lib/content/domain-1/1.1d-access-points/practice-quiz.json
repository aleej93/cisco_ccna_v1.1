				"C": "FlexConnect AP",
				"D": "Cloud-managed AP"
			},
			"correct_answer": "B",

				"A": "FlexConnect",
				"B": "Monitor",
				"C": "Local",
				"D": "Sniffer"

				"B": "Monitor",
				"C": "Rogue Detector",
				"D": "Sniffer"
			},
			"correct_answer": "B",
			"explanation": "Monitor mode APs do not offer a BSS for clients. They are dedicated to receiving 802.11 frames to detect rogue devices and can send de-authentication messages. Rogue Detector mode listens on the wired network only.",

				"A": "Trunk port",
				"B": "Access port",
				"C": "Routed port",
				"D": "Dynamic port"
			},
			"correct_answer": "B",
			"explanation": "Lightweight APs connect to access ports because they tunnel all traffic to the WLC via CAPWAP. They don't need trunk ports because they don't locally switch VLANs. Autonomous APs require trunk ports.",

				"B": "BSSID",
				"C": "ESS-ID",
				"D": "MAC address"
			},
			"correct_answer": "B",
			"explanation": "BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) is the MAC address of an AP's radio and uniquely identifies each AP. SSID is the network name and can be shared by multiple APs in an ESS.",

				"B": "RAP (Root Access Point)",
				"C": "WAP (Wireless Access Point)",
				"D": "BAP (Bridge Access Point)"
			},
			"correct_answer": "B",
			"explanation": "In an MBSS (Mesh Basic Service Set), the RAP (Root Access Point) is connected to the wired network. MAPs (Mesh Access Points) are the other APs that wirelessly connect to form the mesh.",
			"exam_tip": "RAP = Root = Wired connection. MAP = Mesh = Wireless connection.",

				"D": "FlexConnect"
			},
			"correct_answer": "C",

				"B": "DNS",
				"C": "ARP",
				"D": "DHCP"
			},
