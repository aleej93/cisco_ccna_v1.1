## üè≠ SCENARIO 5: Manufacturing Plant (Monitor Mode for Security)

### The Situation

A manufacturing facility with:

- 100 APs providing Wi-Fi for tablets, scanners, AGVs (automated vehicles)
- Sensitive IP: Product designs, formulas
- **Security incident:** Rogue AP discovered in warehouse (employee bypass for personal hotspot)

**Risk:** Rogue AP creates backdoor into corporate network, bypassing firewalls and security controls.

### The Solution

**Dedicated APs in Monitor Mode + Rogue Detection**

**Architecture:**

```
Production APs (Local Mode):
‚îú‚îÄ 100 APs providing normal wireless service
‚îî‚îÄ Users connect for business operations

Security APs (Monitor Mode):
‚îú‚îÄ 10 APs strategically placed for coverage
‚îú‚îÄ Do NOT provide wireless service to clients
‚îî‚îÄ Dedicated to rogue detection

Rogue Detector (Wired Monitoring):
‚îú‚îÄ 5 APs in Rogue Detector mode
‚îú‚îÄ Radios disabled (listen to wired traffic only)
‚îî‚îÄ Correlate wireless rogues with wired network
```

**How Rogue Detection Works:**

1. **Monitor Mode AP detects unauthorized AP:**

   ```
   Monitor AP: "I see SSID 'EmployeeHotspot' with MAC aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
   Monitor AP ‚Üí WLC: "Potential rogue detected"
   ```

2. **WLC classifies threat:**
   - Friendly AP (authorized, known MAC)
   - Rogue AP (unknown, broadcasting on premises)
   - Rogue Client (unauthorized client connecting to rogue)

3. **Rogue Detector confirms:**

   ```
   Rogue Detector: "Listening to wired network..."
   Rogue Detector: "Detected ARP from MAC aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff on wired network"
   Rogue Detector ‚Üí WLC: "Confirmed - rogue is connected to our network!"
   ```

4. **Automated response:**
   - WLC alerts security team
   - Monitor AP sends de-authentication frames to disconnect rogue clients
   - Switch port can be auto-disabled via API integration

**Real-World Outcome:**

**Before Monitor Mode:**

- Rogue APs discovered during quarterly site surveys
- Average: 30-60 days before detection
- 2 security incidents (data exfiltration attempts)

**After Monitor Mode:**

- Real-time rogue detection (&lt; 5 minutes)
- Automated alerts to security team
- Auto-disconnect rogue clients
- **Zero successful breaches** in 18 months

**Key Lesson:** Monitor mode APs provide continuous security surveillance, essential for high-security environments.
