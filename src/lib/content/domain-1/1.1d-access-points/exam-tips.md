# CCNA 200-301 v1.1 | Domain 1.0: Network Fundamentals

## Topic 1.1.d Access Points - Exam Tips

---

## üéØ HIGH-YIELD EXAM TOPICS

These are the most frequently tested concepts for Access Points on the CCNA exam:

### ‚≠ê Must-Know for Exam:

1. **Autonomous vs. Lightweight architectures** - Differences and use cases
2. **CAPWAP protocol** - Ports (5246/5247), encryption status
3. **Lightweight AP modes** - Local, FlexConnect, Monitor
4. **Split-MAC architecture** - What AP handles vs. what WLC handles
5. **Switch port types** - Access port for lightweight, trunk for autonomous
6. **Service Sets** - BSS, ESS, MBSS definitions

---

## üìù COMMON EXAM QUESTION TYPES

### Question Type 1: Architecture Comparison

**Example:**

> "Which statement is true about autonomous access points compared to lightweight access points?"
>
> A) Autonomous APs connect to switch access ports  
> B) Autonomous APs require a wireless LAN controller  
> C) Autonomous APs connect to switch trunk ports ‚úÖ  
> D) Autonomous APs use CAPWAP to communicate with the controller

**How to answer:**

- Remember: **Autonomous = Trunk**, **Lightweight = Access**
- Autonomous APs handle all functions locally and need multiple VLANs (trunk)
- Lightweight APs tunnel everything to WLC (access port is sufficient)

---

### Question Type 2: CAPWAP Protocol Details

**Example:**

> "A network administrator is troubleshooting an issue where lightweight access points cannot connect to the wireless LAN controller. Which two ports must be allowed through the firewall? (Choose two)"
>
> A) TCP 443  
> B) UDP 5246 ‚úÖ  
> C) TCP 5246  
> D) UDP 5247 ‚úÖ  
> E) TCP 22

**How to answer:**

- CAPWAP uses **UDP** (not TCP)
- **Port 5246** = Control tunnel (encrypted by default)
- **Port 5247** = Data tunnel (not encrypted by default)
- Memorize: **"5246 Control, 5247 Data, both UDP"**

---

### Question Type 3: AP Operational Modes

**Example:**

> "A branch office has a lightweight AP that needs to continue providing wireless service even if connectivity to the central WLC is lost. Which AP mode should be configured?"
>
> A) Local  
> B) Monitor  
> C) FlexConnect ‚úÖ  
> D) Sniffer

**How to answer:**

- **Local mode** = default, but requires WLC for data forwarding
- **FlexConnect** = can locally switch traffic if WLC connection fails
- **Monitor** = rogue detection, no BSS offered
- **Sniffer** = packet capture, no BSS offered
- Key word: "continue providing service" ‚Üí FlexConnect

---

### Question Type 4: Split-MAC Architecture

**Example:**

> "In a split-MAC architecture, which function is handled by the lightweight access point?"
>
> A) Client authentication  
> B) RF management  
> C) Real-time encryption/decryption ‚úÖ  
> D) QoS policy enforcement

**How to answer:**

- **AP handles:** Time-sensitive functions (transmit/receive RF, encryption/decryption, beacons)
- **WLC handles:** Management functions (authentication, RF management, QoS, roaming)
- If the task is **real-time or latency-sensitive** ‚Üí AP handles it
- If the task is **management or policy-based** ‚Üí WLC handles it

---

### Question Type 5: Service Sets

**Example:**

> "An enterprise has deployed 20 access points throughout a building, all broadcasting the same SSID 'CorpNet'. This deployment is an example of which service set?"
>
> A) BSS  
> B) ESS ‚úÖ  
> C) IBSS  
> D) MBSS

**How to answer:**

- **BSS** = 1 AP, 1 BSSID
- **ESS** = Multiple APs, same SSID (extended service set) ‚Üê Most common enterprise setup
- **IBSS** = Ad-hoc mode (device-to-device, no AP)
- **MBSS** = Mesh network (RAP + MAPs)
- Key words: "multiple APs" + "same SSID" ‚Üí ESS

---

### Question Type 6: Association Process

**Example:**

> "Which three connection states exist during the 802.11 association process? (Choose three)"
>
> A) Not authenticated, not associated ‚úÖ  
> B) Authenticated, not associated ‚úÖ  
> C) Not authenticated, associated  
> D) Authenticated and associated ‚úÖ  
> E) Authorized, associated

**How to answer:**

- Three valid states:
  1. **Not authenticated, not associated** (initial state)
  2. **Authenticated, not associated** (after authentication request/response)
  3. **Authenticated and associated** (fully connected, can send traffic)
- **Invalid state:** You cannot be associated without being authenticated first
- Memorize the progression: **Not auth/not assoc ‚Üí Auth/not assoc ‚Üí Auth/assoc**

## üö´ COMMON EXAM TRAPS & MISTAKES

### Trap 1: Confusing CAPWAP Port Numbers

‚ùå **Wrong:** "CAPWAP uses TCP port 5246"  
‚úÖ **Correct:** "CAPWAP uses UDP port 5246"

**Tip:** Remember UDP for both CAPWAP ports (5246 and 5247). If an answer says TCP, it's wrong.

---

### Trap 2: Assuming Data Tunnel is Encrypted

‚ùå **Wrong:** "Both CAPWAP tunnels are encrypted by default"  
‚úÖ **Correct:** "Control tunnel (5246) is encrypted by default, Data tunnel (5247) is NOT"

**Tip:** Control = Always secure. Data = Optional DTLS encryption (not default).

---

### Trap 3: Mixing Up Port Types

‚ùå **Wrong:** "Lightweight APs connect to trunk ports"  
‚úÖ **Correct:** "Lightweight APs connect to access ports"

**Tip:**

- **Lightweight AP ‚Üí Access port** (tunnels all traffic to WLC)
- **Autonomous AP ‚Üí Trunk port** (locally bridges multiple VLANs)

---

### Trap 4: Thinking Local Mode Survives WLC Failure

‚ùå **Wrong:** "Local mode APs can forward traffic if WLC goes down"  
‚úÖ **Correct:** "FlexConnect mode APs can forward traffic if WLC goes down"

**Tip:** "Local" = requires WLC. "FlexConnect" = survives WLC failure.

---

### Trap 5: Confusing BSS and ESS

‚ùå **Wrong:** "A single AP with multiple SSIDs is an ESS"  
‚úÖ **Correct:** "Multiple APs with the same SSID form an ESS"

**Tip:**

- **BSS = Basic = One AP**
- **ESS = Extended = Multiple APs, one logical network**

---

## üß† MEMORY AIDS & MNEMONICS

### CAPWAP Ports Mnemonic

**"Control comes BEFORE Data"**

- 5246 = Control (smaller number comes first)
- 5247 = Data (larger number comes second)

**"Control is SECURE"**

- Control tunnel = Encrypted by default
- Data tunnel = NOT encrypted by default

---

### Split-MAC Mnemonic

**"APs are FAST, WLCs are SMART"**

- **AP (Fast):** Real-time tasks (encrypt, transmit RF, beacons)
- **WLC (Smart):** Management tasks (authentication, RF optimization, policies)

---

### AP Mode Decision Tree

```
Does the AP offer wireless access to clients?
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ YES

```

### Port Type Memory Aid

**"Light and Simple"**

- **Lightweight** = Light load on switch = **Access port** (simple)
- **Autonomous** = Heavy load, multiple VLANs = **Trunk port** (complex)

## üîë EXAM DAY CHECKLIST

Before the exam, ensure you can answer these without hesitation:

‚úÖ **"What ports does CAPWAP use?"**  
‚Üí UDP 5246 (control, encrypted) and UDP 5247 (data, not encrypted)

‚úÖ **"Lightweight or Autonomous - which uses trunk ports?"**  
‚Üí Autonomous (lightweight uses access ports)

‚úÖ **"What AP mode survives WLC failure?"**  
‚Üí FlexConnect

‚úÖ **"What's the difference between BSS and ESS?"**  
‚Üí BSS = one AP, ESS = multiple APs with same SSID

‚úÖ **"In split-MAC, does the AP or WLC handle authentication?"**  
‚Üí WLC handles authentication (AP handles real-time RF tasks)

**If you can answer all five instantly, you're ready for the AP questions on exam day!**

---

## üöÄ FINAL EXAM TIP

**The #1 mistake students make:** Overthinking wireless questions.

**The solution:** Stick to the fundamentals:

- Lightweight = Modern, scalable, controller-based
- Autonomous = Legacy, standalone, not scalable
- CAPWAP = UDP 5246 + 5247
- FlexConnect = Survives WLC failure
- Access ports for lightweight, trunk for autonomous

Master these facts, and wireless questions become easy points on exam day.
