# Real-World Applications: Next-generation Firewalls and IPS

## Scenario 1: Protecting a Multi-Branch Company Network

### **The Situation**

TechCorp has three office locations:

- **Headquarters** in New York (200 employees)
- **Branch Office** in Chicago (50 employees)
- **Branch Office** in Los Angeles (50 employees)

All offices need to:

- Access the Internet safely
- Communicate with each other securely
- Protect against external attacks
- Comply with industry security regulations

### **The Solution**

**Deployment Strategy:**

```
Internet
   |
[NGFW + IPS] ← Headquarters Firewall
   |
Headquarters LAN
   |
   +--- VPN Tunnels ---+
   |                   |
[NGFW + IPS]      [NGFW + IPS]
   |                   |
Chicago LAN       Los Angeles LAN
```

**Each location has:**

- A **Next-Generation Firewall** at the Internet edge
- Integrated **IPS** for real-time threat prevention
- VPN capabilities for secure inter-office communication

### **What This Accomplishes**

✅ **Perimeter Security** — Each office is protected from Internet-based threats  
✅ **Threat Prevention** — IPS automatically blocks known attacks  
✅ **Application Control** — NGFW can block risky applications (torrents, unauthorized file sharing)  
✅ **Secure Communication** — VPN tunnels encrypt traffic between offices  
✅ **Centralized Management** — Security team can monitor all three firewalls from HQ

### **Real Attack Scenario**

**Monday, 9:15 AM:**  
An employee in the Chicago office receives a phishing email with a malicious link.

**What Happens:**

1. Employee clicks the link
2. The malicious website tries to download malware
3. **The IPS detects the malware signature** in the download traffic
4. **Traffic is blocked immediately** — malware never reaches the employee's computer
5. Security team receives an alert
6. IT investigates and provides security awareness training

**Without IPS:** The malware would have infected the computer, potentially spreading to other systems and stealing data.

**With IPS:** The threat was stopped at the network edge before any damage occurred.

## Scenario 2: E-commerce Website Protection

### **The Situation**

OnlineShop.com runs an e-commerce website that processes thousands of transactions daily. They face constant threats:

- DDoS attacks trying to take the site offline
- SQL injection attempts targeting their database
- Credential stuffing attacks on customer accounts
- Credit card data theft attempts

### **The Solution**

**Architecture:**

```
         Internet
            |
    [NGFW with IPS]
            |
    [Load Balancer]
       /        \
[Web Server] [Web Server]
       \        /
    [Database Server]
```

**Security Features Deployed:**

- **NGFW with Application Layer Filtering**
  - Inspects HTTP/HTTPS traffic
  - Blocks malformed requests
  - Rate-limits suspicious sources

- **IPS with Custom Signatures**
  - SQL injection detection
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
  - Known vulnerability signatures

- **Geo-blocking**
  - Blocks traffic from high-risk countries where they don't do business

### **Real Attack Scenario**

**Friday Night, 11:47 PM:**  
A coordinated attack begins:

**Attack Type 1: SQL Injection**

- Attacker sends: `' OR '1'='1`
- **IPS detects the SQL injection pattern**
- **Request is dropped immediately**
- Database is never queried

**Attack Type 2: DDoS**

- 10,000 requests per second from a botnet
- **NGFW rate-limiting kicks in**
- **Legitimate customers continue shopping normally**
- Attack traffic is filtered out

**Result:** The website stays online, no data is stolen, and customers complete their purchases without interruption.

## Scenario 3: Healthcare Organization Compliance

### **The Situation**

City Hospital must comply with **HIPAA regulations** that require:

- Protecting patient health information (PHI)
- Monitoring and logging all access to medical records
- Preventing unauthorized access to systems
- Detecting and responding to security incidents

### **The Solution**

**Security Stack:**

```
Internet
   |
[NGFW + IPS + Logging]
   |
   +-- DMZ (Public-facing systems)
   |   |
   |   +-- [Patient Portal]
   |   +-- [Appointment System]
   |
   +-- Internal Network
       |
       +-- [Electronic Health Records]
       +-- [Billing System]
       +-- [Medical Imaging]
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Application Control**
   - Only authorized medical applications can access EHR systems
   - Personal cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive) is blocked

2. **Deep Packet Inspection**
   - NGFW inspects encrypted traffic for data exfiltration attempts
   - Detects if PHI is being sent to unauthorized destinations

3. **IPS Protection**
   - Blocks ransomware command-and-control traffic
   - Prevents exploitation of vulnerabilities in medical devices

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - All firewall decisions are logged for compliance audits
   - Security team can prove due diligence

### **Real Attack Scenario**

**Wednesday, 2:30 PM:**  
A doctor's laptop is infected with ransomware after opening a malicious attachment.

**What Happens:**

1. Ransomware attempts to encrypt files on the local laptop
2. Ransomware tries to spread to the network and encrypt the EHR database
3. **IPS detects unusual SMB traffic patterns** (ransomware spreading behavior)
4. **Infected laptop is automatically quarantined** — network access blocked
5. **Backup systems remain unaffected** — no patient data is lost
6. Security team isolates and cleans the laptop
7. Incident is documented for HIPAA compliance reporting

**Impact:** Zero patient data loss, no downtime for medical services, full compliance maintained.

## Scenario 4: Remote Work Security

### **The Situation**

After COVID-19, FinanceCorp shifted to a hybrid work model:

- 60% of employees work from home at least 3 days per week
- Employees need access to sensitive financial systems
- Home networks are less secure than office networks
- Company must prevent data breaches

### **The Challenge**

Home users are vulnerable to:

- Compromised home routers
- Malware on personal devices
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on public WiFi
- Phishing attacks targeting remote workers

### **The Solution**

**VPN with Integrated NGFW/IPS:**

```
[Remote Employee Home]
         |
    VPN Tunnel (Encrypted)
         |
[NGFW + IPS at HQ]
         |
[Corporate Network]
         |
[Financial Systems]
```

**Security Controls:**

1. **VPN Requirement**
   - All remote access goes through VPN
   - Traffic is encrypted end-to-end

2. **NGFW Inspection**
   - Even VPN traffic is inspected for threats
   - Malware from home networks can't enter corporate network

3. **Host-based Firewall + IPS**
   - Company-issued laptops have host-based firewalls enabled
   - Combined with network NGFW for defense-in-depth

4. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Users authenticate with MFA
   - Access is granted only to specific applications needed
   - All traffic is logged and monitored

### **Real Attack Scenario**

**Monday, 8:00 AM:**  
An employee working from a coffee shop connects to corporate VPN.

**Background:** The coffee shop WiFi was compromised by an attacker conducting a man-in-the-middle attack.

**What Happens:**

1. Employee connects to compromised WiFi
2. Attacker intercepts the connection attempt
3. **VPN encryption protects the traffic** — attacker can't read it
4. Employee successfully connects to corporate network through VPN
5. **All traffic is routed through the NGFW/IPS at HQ**
6. Attacker tries to inject malicious traffic
7. **IPS detects and blocks the attack**

**Result:** Employee works securely, attacker gains nothing, corporate data remains protected.

## Scenario 5: Blocking Targeted Application Attacks

### **The Situation**

A manufacturing company uses custom-developed software for factory automation. A competitor wants to steal their proprietary processes and conducts a targeted attack.

### **The Attack**

1. Attackers research the company's systems
2. They discover a vulnerability in an older version of the automation software
3. They craft a custom exploit to take advantage of this vulnerability
4. The exploit is sent through a phishing campaign

### **How NGFW + IPS Protects**

**Traditional Firewall Response:**

- ❌ Only checks ports and IP addresses
- ❌ Allows traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) — looks legitimate
- ❌ Attack succeeds

**NGFW + IPS Response:**

1. **Application Identification**
   - NGFW identifies the automation software traffic
   - Applies specific security policies

2. **Deep Packet Inspection**
   - Examines the content of the packets, not just headers
   - Detects abnormal patterns in the application data

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - IPS notices unusual commands being sent to the automation software
   - These commands don't match normal operational patterns

4. **Threat Prevention**
   - ✅ IPS blocks the malicious traffic
   - ✅ Alert sent to security team
   - ✅ Connection is terminated
   - ✅ Attacker's IP is blacklisted

**Result:** The targeted attack is stopped, proprietary processes remain secure, and production continues without interruption.
