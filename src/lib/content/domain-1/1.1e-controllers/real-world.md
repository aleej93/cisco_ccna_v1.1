## üîß Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Issue 1: APs Not Joining WLC

**Symptoms:**
- APs stuck in "Discovering" state
- APs reboot continuously

**Common Causes:**
1. ‚ùå Missing DHCP Option 43
2. ‚ùå No IP connectivity between AP and WLC
3. ‚ùå Firewall blocking CAPWAP ports (UDP 5246/5247)
4. ‚ùå AP and WLC software version mismatch

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Verify AP has IP address: `show ip dhcp binding`
2. Check DHCP Option 43: `show run | include option 43`
3. Test connectivity: `ping <WLC-IP> source vlan <mgmt-vlan>`
4. Check WLC logs: `show ap join stats summary all`
5. Verify firewall permits UDP 5246/5247

### Issue 2: Poor Wireless Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Slow client speeds
- Frequent disconnections
- High latency

**Common Causes:**
1. ‚ùå Channel interference (co-channel or adjacent-channel)
2. ‚ùå Overloaded AP (too many clients)
3. ‚ùå Weak signal strength (RSSI &lt; -75 dBm)
4. ‚ùå Incorrect QoS settings

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check channel utilization: `show ap auto-rf 802.11a summary`
2. Review client distribution: `show ap summary` (check Clients column)
3. Verify client RSSI: `show client detail <MAC>` (should be &gt; -70 dBm)
4. Enable load balancing: WLC &gt; Wireless &gt; 802.11a/b &gt; Load Balancing

---

### Issue 3: Clients Cannot Obtain IP Addresses

**Symptoms:**
- Clients associate but no Internet access
- Limited connectivity messages
- Self-assigned IPs (169.254.x.x)

**Common Causes:**
1. ‚ùå DHCP server unreachable
2. ‚ùå DHCP pool exhausted
3. ‚ùå Incorrect VLAN mapping (WLAN to dynamic interface)

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check DHCP pool: `show ip dhcp pool <pool-name>`
2. Verify DHCP bindings: `show ip dhcp binding`
3. Test DHCP from WLC virtual interface: `test dhcp vlan <client-vlan>`
4. Verify WLAN-to-VLAN mapping: `show wlan <ID>` (check Interface/Interface Group)

### Network Operations Center (NOC) Analyst

**WLC-Related Tasks:**
- Monitor WLC health and AP status
- Respond to alerts (AP down, high client density)
- Perform basic troubleshooting (AP not joining, clients can't connect)
- Escalate complex issues to wireless team

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- WLC CPU and memory utilization
- Number of joined APs
- Client count per AP
- Failed authentication attempts
